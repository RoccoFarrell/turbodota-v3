Greetings Turbodota challengers! ðŸ‘‹

## Welcome to the January release of Turbodota.

The Turbodota team is excited for our first major release of 2024. This release includes some modifications to improve the competitiveness of the next season as well as new functionality to change up your experience. We regret to inform you that due to an entire overhaul of infrastructure required for this update we are going to be ending Season 2 early and starting a fresh new season so everyone can compete fairly!

## Updates in the new season:

#### * New Quest Board 
    * Players now have a quest board with 3 quest slots
    * Quests can either be completed or failed depending on if you win or lose while on a hero specific quest
#### * Introduction of XP system and boosts for successful quests
    * Finishing a quest will now reward XP and/or Gold depending on if a quest was successfully completed or not
    * Successful Quests will reward 150 XP and 100 Gold
    * Failed Quests will reward 100 XP and 0 Gold
#### * Shop Now Available
    * Players can now access the shop to buy items to strategically improve their TurboTown
    * New Item - Observer Ward: When used a player gets to choose between 3 random options for their next quest.
