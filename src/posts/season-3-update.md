Greetings Turbodota challengers! ðŸ‘‹

I hope Season 3 is going well! We have a few mid season updates for you to buff your creeps and amp your spells.

## Mid Season 3 Update

#### * New Item: Quelling Blade 
    * Chop down those pesky heroes!
    * Quelling Blade costs 300g and allows you to skip a quest
#### * Town Feed
    * Check out the progress of your friends in the Season by clicking the Notification bell in the top right!

Thanks, and good luck with season 3!
