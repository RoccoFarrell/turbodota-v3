### Season 2 Details

 Season 2 has now begun with the same ruleset, giving everyone a fresh start to compete now that the holidays have gone by. 
 
 We are currently working on restructuring the season management to allow us to properly show a season 1 vs season 2 leaderboard. In the interim, your random completions will be displayed on the season 1 leaderboard. We apologize for this inconvenience, but rest assured we (Rocco) will solve this shortly and your efforts in season 2 will not be lost, so get randoming! 
 
 In addition to this we wanted to announce that while there is not yet an exact end date for season 2, we anticipate this being a slightly shorter season with season 3 around the corner brining new functionality and a fresh take on the experience, we hope you are as excited as we are. We appreciate all of your interest in turbodota's season functionality and we can't wait to continue to deliver a fresh new experience in the future.

Thanks,
No Salt Studios
